Automatic Street Light System - ICT 215 Project
Department of Computer Engineering, Bells University of Technology

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an automated lighting solution designed to optimize energy consumption in urban environments. Using an Arduino Uno and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), the system automatically detects ambient light levels and toggles street lamps (LEDs) accordingly.

🛠 Features
Real-time Sensing: Continuously monitors light intensity.
Automated Logic: Zero human intervention required for switching.
Simulated & Physical Validation: Tested thoroughly in Proteus, Tinkercad, and on a physical PCB.
Energy Efficient: Reduces electricity wastage during daylight hours.
